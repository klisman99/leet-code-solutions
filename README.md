# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! This project contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each file is named after the corresponding problem on the [LeetCode website](https://leetcode.com/), making it easy to identify which solution corresponds to which challenge.

## About This Repository

- **Purpose**: This repository serves as a record of my problem-solving journey on LeetCode. I’ve worked through these problems independently to improve my coding and algorithmic thinking skills.
- **Solutions**: The solutions are written mostly in python. Each file contains my approach to solving the problem, often with comments explaining my thought process.
- **Quality Disclaimer**: Please note that while all solutions here are functional and solve the respective problems, they are not always the most optimal in terms of time or space complexity. These are the results of my own thinking and experimentation, and I’ve prioritized understanding over perfection. Over time, I may revisit and optimize some of these solutions.
